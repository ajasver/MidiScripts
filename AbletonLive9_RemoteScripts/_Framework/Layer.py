    grab all controls and will forward them to its own owner when he
    receives them, and will take them from him when they are
    release. The layer with give and take away the controls from its
    client using methods of the form::
    
        client.set[control-name](control)

    to components indirectly, with automatic handling of competition

    names: priority, grab, release, on_received, on_lost, owner,
    get_owner
